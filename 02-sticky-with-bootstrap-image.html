    <h1>Turning Passion into Profit: How Afro-Latinas are Redefining Latino Identity Through Entrepreneruship</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="container">

  <p class=afrolatinas_story> Janel Martinez grew up captivated by the different worlds brought to her living room as she tuned into her favorite 90s sitcoms and turned the glossy pages of magazines. She was enthralled by journalism and fell in love with storytelling, but had to dig deep to find any representation of someone who looked like her in mainstream or Spanish language media.</p>

  <p class=afrolatinas_story> Martinez is Afro-Latina. Born to Honduran-Garifuna parents and raised in the Bronx, she grew up searching for depictions of herself as she enthusiastically read issues of ESSENCE, Jet, and People en Español.</p>

  <p class=afrolatinas_story> She seldom found this type of representative programming as the media landscape lacked reporting and stories on intersectional communities that are confined to the margins of cultures and ethnicities. Martinez recognized this and created Ain’t I Latina, an online destination for Afro-Latinas searching for portrayals of their narratives.</p>

  <p class=afrolatinas_story> “I saw a problem with the media’s lack of representation,“ said the 27-year-old, who also helped launch a diversity and inclusion firm in 2014 called 20/20 Shift.“I wanted to tell stories about people of color, so I started Ain’t I Latina because I was passionate about seeing that representation.”</p>

  <p class=afrolatinas_story> Latino-owned businesses are the fastest growing sector of the US economy when it comes to looking at the race and ethnicity of ownership, according to federal census data. The expansion is happening faster than the country’s Latino population growth, but the conversation around Latino entrepreneurship fails to acknowledge the role Black Latinos play in this development.</p>

  <p class=afrolatinas_story> What started as a blog to highlight and celebrate the diversity in the Latino community, quickly became a self-sustaining business. Ain’t I Latina became a platform for Afro-Latinas to share their experiences, and an inclusive space for voices left out of critical conversations that shape Latino identity. </p>

  <p class=afrolatinas_story> Ain’t I Latina grew to not only inspire fellow Afro-Latinas and foster community but also to work with brands that wished to reach this particular segment of the population.</p>

  <p class=afrolatinas_story> “Within a few months of launching Ain’t I Latina, I realized I could monetize it because people started asking me to speak on how to launch a content-based business,” said Martinez. “People started approaching me about sponsored posts on my blog because they wanted to pay to have face time with the community that we were building.” </p>

  <p class=afrolatinas_story> Martinez’s business grew exponentially, and within the first year, she produced events with multiple sponsors and free giveaways.</p>

  <p class=afrolatinas_story> Teen pregnancy rates in the Bronx remain the highest in the state for females 15–19 years old. Teenagers accounted for 77 pregnancies per 1,000 in the Bronx while there are 54.4 teen pregnancies per 1,000 in the city overall.</p>

  <p class=afrolatinas_story> “People showed me that they saw value in Ain’t I Latina,” she said.</p>

  <p class=afrolatinas_story> Martinez’s business launch and expansion is representative of the prominent role Latina-owned firms play in the overall growth of all Latino-owned businesses in the United States.</p>

  <p class=afrolatinas_story> A new study from the Latino Entrepreneurship Initiative (SLEI) of Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business found that Latino-owned businesses are the fastest growing sector of all other ethnic groups. In 2012, there were 3.3 million Latino-owned businesses. </p>
